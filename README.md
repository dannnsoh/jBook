# JBook

This is an interactive coding environment. You can write Javascript, see it get executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

-   Click any text cell to edit it
-   The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file, if you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell!
-   You can require or import modules like you would in a normal javascript file
-   You can show any string, number, or even React components, or anything else by calling the **_show_** function _eg. show("Hello World")_. This is a function built into this environment. Call show mulitple times to show multiple values
-   Re-order or delete cells using the buttons in the top right corner of a cell
-   Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell

All of your changes get saved to the file you opened JBook with. So if you ran **_npx run jbook serve test.js_**, all the text and code you write will be saved to the **_test.js_** file
